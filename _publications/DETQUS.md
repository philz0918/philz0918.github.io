excerpt: "DETQUS introduces a decomposition-based transformer system that improves query-focused table-to-text summarization through column pruning and ROUGE-L gains."

Query-focused tabular summarization is a challenging table-to-text task where summaries must answer user queries by extracting relevant content from large tables. DETQUS proposes a decomposition-based transformer system that reduces table complexity while preserving key information. By pruning irrelevant columns and applying a fine-tuned encoder-decoder model, DETQUS improves summarization efficiency and achieves a ROUGE-L score of 0.4437, outperforming the state-of-the-art REFACToR baseline. This paper presents DETQUS as a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world query-focused summarization.
