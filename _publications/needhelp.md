This study examines the online information-seeking behavior of international students in the United States. Following the onset of COVID-19, their need for timely and relevant information becomes critical. Despite greater challenges than domestic students, limited research explores how international students use online platforms to meet their unique information needs. With online communities being essential sources of information and bridges for online social capital, our study analyzes the r/f1visa subreddit to examine international students’ information-seeking patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we identify unmet information needs through members' interactions and recurring questions.
