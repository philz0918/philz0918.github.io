The present study aims to examine the threshold of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy over time and public discourse around COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. We collected 3,952 questions and 66,820 answers regarding COVID-19 vaccination posted on Quora between June 2020 and June 2021, and applied Word2Vec and sentiment analysis. Our analysis segmented the data into 25 bi-weekly sections to understand trends in perception and hesitancy.
