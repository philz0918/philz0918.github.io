This study compares anti-Asian discourse before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from Quora, one of the most widely used community Q&A platforms. The authors created datasets of questions and answers mentioning “Asians” and “anti-Asians” posted between 2010 and 2021. A total of 1,477 questions and 5,346 answers were analyzed and divided into two periods: before and during the pandemic. Methods included topic modeling and word embedding (Word2Vec) to identify thematic changes. Pre-pandemic discourse focused on racism and physical differences, while pandemic-era discourse emphasized hate crimes and solidarity movements.
