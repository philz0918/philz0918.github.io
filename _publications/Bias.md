excerpt: "This study compares rule-based and deep learning systems for classifying political bias in news, examining their transparency, accuracy, and robustness to unseen data."

The unchecked spread of misinformation and increasing political polarization have raised demand for systems that automatically detect political bias in news. This study compares rule-based and deep learning approaches, applying both to CNN (left-leaning) and FOX (right-leaning) articles. It finds that rule-based models perform more consistently and transparently across data conditions, while deep learning models show higher sensitivity to training data and lower explainability. The work offers insight into designing robust, interpretable political bias classifiers.
