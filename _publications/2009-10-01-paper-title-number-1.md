Fire safety on construction sites has been rarely studied because fire accidents have a lower occurrence compared to construction’s “Fatal Four.” Despite the lower occurrence, construction fire accidents tend to have a larger severity of impact. This study uses web crawling and big data analysis techniques to identify patterns and contributing factors of fire accidents on construction sites. News reports were collected, keywords were analyzed for media exposure, and fire safety violations and inspection gaps were found to be key risk factors.
