This study examines how international students in the United States seek information online, focusing on interactions in the r/f1visa subreddit before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis reveals a shift from pre-pandemic discussions about employment to pandemic-era concerns such as travel restrictions, financial hardship, and entry issues, along with increased similarity in recurring questions that reflects shared struggles and solidarity. Using the lens of online social capital, the findings show how crisis conditions blur bonding and bridging capital and highlight the need for more responsive and inclusive information environments for international students.
