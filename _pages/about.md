[academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the **University of Florida**, fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Bonnie J. Dorr](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/~bonniejdorr) in the **NLP & C (Natural Language Processing and Culture) Laboratory** within the **Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Science, and Network Science**.

Currently, I am developing models to detect **internal hidden mental states (e.g., emotions)** and external **linguistic cues (e.g., politeness and formality)** in language. Through this work, I aim to explore:

The relationship between mixed emotions and mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety)

The correlation between communication gaps in online conversations and AI-predicted mental health risks

Prior to joining UF, I earned a **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Data Science** from **Sungkyunkwan University**, and a **Master of Science in Data Science** from the **Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University**.
