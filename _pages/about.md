I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science in the Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) within the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Bonnie J. Dorr](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/~bonniejdorr) in the NLP & C (Natural Language Processing and Culture) Laboratory.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Science, and Artificual Intelligent. 

My work focuses on building effective, interpretable models by incorporating linguistic information, a direction central to my dissertation, **“REFLECT: Role-Aware Extraction of Forms of Linguistic Expression for Communication Tracking”**. Within this framework, I develop role-aware models using semantic role labeling (SRL) to detect internal states (sentiment, emotion), external cues (politeness, formality), and linguistic divergences, with the goal of uncovering communication gaps between interactional signals and communication effectiveness proxies. This framework extends to multilingual settings through my work on explainable cross-lingual SRL transfer, enabled by a novel, linguistically inspired projection method, alongside a visualization tool for BERT designed to enhance understanding of its cross-lingual mechanism

Prior to joining UF, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Data Science from Sungkyunkwan University, and a Master of Science in Data Science from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University.

I am a passionate CrossFitter and ski lover🎿.
