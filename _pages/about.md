I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Bonnie J. Dorr](https://nlp.cise.ufl.edu/~bonniejdorr) in the NLP & C (Natural Language Processing and Culture) Laboratory within the Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Science, and Artificual Intelligent. 

Currently, I am developing models to detect internal states (e.g., sentiment and emotion) and external linguistic cues (e.g., politeness and formality) in language using semantic role labeling (SRL). Through this work, I aim to examine:

- Development of a role-aware model for detecting internal states and external lingustic cues.
- Multilingual extension of the internal states and external linguistic cue detection model.
- Analysis of the relationship between both internal states and external linguistic cues, and communication gaps (e.g., mismatched intentions).

Prior to joining UF, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Data Science from Sungkyunkwan University, and a Master of Science in Data Science from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University.

I am a passionate CrossFitter and ski lover🎿.
